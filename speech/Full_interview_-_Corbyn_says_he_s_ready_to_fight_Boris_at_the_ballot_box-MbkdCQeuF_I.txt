 you absolutely I've got myself our campaign plan in place. We've got most of our candidates selecting all our marginal constituencies. We have many of our policy announcements in place particularly the ones on the green Industrial Revolution and the green New Deal that we're putting forward and working out more details on our Health and Social care policies, but fundamentally, it's about reducing inequality and Britain and about investing in good quality sustainable jobs for the future through the green energy Revolution

They do get the choice real choice of an apprenticeship or university

 Minister Parliament goes back in September and I think it's at that point. We'll look at the situation there, but it's also up to the Prime Minister what he decides to do as well because if he's trying to take us out on a No Deal brexit the end of October we will oppose that

 I can guarantee you this we will do everything to prevent a No Deal exit and will do everything to challenge this government and we'll do it at a time by choosing. Okay.

 Well an election takes about seven weeks from the point at which Parliament votes to hold it under the fixed term parliament's act and two-thirds of all MPS have to vote for it. But if the government puts that down such a motion we would support it because we think the public duties open election. We have a government that doesn't really have a majority that has a deal made with the dup some years ago and cannot win votes in Parliament to resume Was Defeated more times than any other prime minister by the biggest majorities ever and Johnson has put together a cabinet of ideologically extremely right-wing people and the leader of the house instead of getting on with reforming Parliament seems more concerned about apostrophes at the end of letters.

 Now let's talk about brexit. Shall we because when that election comes brexit will be of utmost importance to many people including people here in Mansfield, which voted 70% to leave the EU they're going to want to know what your policy is on brexit. So what is it a you now supporting a second referendum at all

 circumstances what we're saying is no deal we depose and we would think the people should have a final choice on it. They could have a vote then between remain or whatever option Boris Johnson decides to put them at that time. But I'd also say to Mansfield and to everywhere else is you've not had the investment you should have had British governments have walked by on the other side and not invested in good quality job since the end of the coal industry, but you also need a government that's going to invest in the future to reduce those inequalities. It's a Labour government that will invest in the future and we need to maintain a trading relationship with Europe a trading relationship. For our manufacturing industry and for our food processing and Food Industries as well also issues like medicine Supply. And of course the Northern Ireland border is a key issue and any deal that damages the Belfast agreement which is an international treaty simply not going to

 Now we need to talk about anti-Semitism. This is your first major interview as since the Panorama documentary. I don't know if you watched it. And what did you think of it?

 I was upset that's the feelings of some of our former staff what they said. I was upset at the way the program was characterized and presented and we have put in some complaints surrounding that I'm very clear. There's no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism in our society in our communities or in my party since I became leader I asked and she did it Chamois chakrabarty to report into it and develop a process when Jenny form be took over as general secretary in successor to a McNichol. I asked her to deal with it in a speedy and timely manner we recruited more staff and we improved our processes and the process of going through four times faster. I also recognize that where there is prima facie evidence of serious abuse than there is a need for a faster process. I looked into that and put it to the shadow cabinet. Elementary Labour party and the national executive my own party last week and they agreed with me that had to be a faster process which is now being developed into rules occur before this year's conference. We are very clear. We're not accepting any form of antisemitism in our party. We've also by the way adopted a definitional islamophobia. And any other form of racism is totally unacceptable completely open about that and where it happens and it has happened to in cases of less than North women percent of our membership we deal with

 it and just to look at some of the allegations that former members of the Labour party made in that documentary. They were talking about effectively interference in the pre-sentence and I'm going to read some of what they said and Cat bokkeum. I quit the party with nowhere to go and had a breakdown Saint Matthews. I actively considered committing suicide Louise with us green. I was signed off with depression and anxiety.

 I feel very sorry and very sad for them. The first thing I did when I became leader of the party was to ask a senior staff what processes are available for staff support because of stress at work that was without any new anti-Semitism just the whole principles of stress at work. I feel very strongly about that. And that support has to be there some of those people had to work very hard. They were overwhelmed by cases letters and so on and remember our party membership virtually forever being undermined virtually troubled. Well, they were being asked to work are very fast on a lot of very complex issues and in some cases they had to sift through a lot of things to find it actually the complainant sometimes weren't even Labour party members.

 and now what I don't understand when I look at the antisemitism story we've talked about before you spoke about in interviews before it's been going on for years. Now. Why don't you just set up an independent process to deal with it that way then just stop all of this wouldn't it? No, that's what people have called for. That's what you know, for example, the board of deputies a Jewish Leadership Council called for why don't you just do it.

 Nobody else has an independent process when they're an organization's what we do have is legal oversight of the process to ensure consistency in decision making and when and the equalities Human Rights Commission concludes, its report we will obviously listen very carefully to what they have to say. I do think there has to be a legally robust process. We also have a degree of Independence in the party. There's something called the national constitutional committee, which is completely independently of the national executive. They make the final decision

 and what we saw among other things with more MPS appointed to Cabinet from ethnic minorities than we've ever seen before admittedly. It's a pretty low bar. Is that something? You're welcome.

 Well, I welcome diversity of course and I welcome that our Parliament is beginning to look a bit more like the rest of the population does but it's got a long way to go after all as 1987 the first four black MPS were elected and it was quite a while before substantially more joined them as Shadow cabinet is extremely diverse. Our team is extremely diverse. Our party membership is extremely diverse our society's very diverse, but you've got to start doing monitoring of all big organizations where you find diversity often at the lowest levels in any organization and that sort of diversity reduces and diminishes the near you get to the top of it, but it's also about education. It's about understanding. It's about history somebody probably To on Butler eyeshadow equalities Minister has produced the ideas and we mention emancipation education trust so we can understand something our children can understand something more about how the slave trade came about how the slave trade was opposed and how eventually slavery was abolished.

 I just want to read you a tweet that was sent by Shelley Minister Clive Lewis towards James cleverly who's the new party chairman of the conservative party. He congratulated him on the appointment and said, I'm just sorry that you and other black members of the cabinet had to sell your souls and self-respect to get there. Do you think I sold

 ourselves? The conservatives they believe in conservatism. They've been appointed in their party. I'd leave it at that. I want diversity at all levels in our society.

 racist Boris Johnson has said some awful comments about black children about Muslim women and about people within our society in our community, which I absolutely condemn. I hope he will understand the hurt that he caused with the remarks that he made
